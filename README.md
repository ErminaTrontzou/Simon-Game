# Simon Game
Inspired and challenged by the Course [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) of [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) on Udemy. 

>I saw this challenge as an opportunity to test my current knowledge for these languages at its fullest and not just make the game exactly as Dr. Angela suggests and walksthrough.

## Gameplay
The buttons create a series of tones and lights and require a user to repeat the sequence.
Once the user fails the game is over.

## History
Simon is named after the simple children's game of Simon Says,  
but the gameplay is based on Atari's unpopular Touch Me arcade game from 1974.
The inventors of this game are *Ralph H. Baer* and *Howard J. Morrison*.
